PUT Endpoint Works in UI but Returns 405 in API 

Description: 
When trying to update an existing employee using PUT `/api/Employees/{id}`, the API returns `405 Method Not Allowed`. However, the same action works from the UI.

Repro Steps
 
1. Create a new employee via POST `/api/Employees`  
2. Copy the employee `id` from the response  
3. Send a PUT request to `/api/Employees/{id}` with a valid body:  
```json
{
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Doe",
  "username": "john.doe",
  "dependants": 2,
  "salary": 50000
}
